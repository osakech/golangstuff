0. cd into sisu_csvProcessor
	I would recommend to open two shells
1. Start app2 first
	go run app2/main.go
2. Start app1 as oft as you want
	- keep in mind that data.csv has to in be same folder the executable is started 
	go run app1/main.go
3. Open the Browser with the Url: http://localhost:8080/monitoring/
